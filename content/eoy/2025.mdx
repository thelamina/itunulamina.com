Looking back at 2025, I've realized that the most beautiful growth often happens in the quiet. It wasn't a year of loud career milestones or rapid expansion; instead, it was a year of finally learning how to be whole. The highlight of my world has been falling in love with my girlfriend over and over again. Even as we approach our first anniversary, every day carries that "Day 1" spark, that rare, sweet magic that makes the long-term feel like a brand-new beginning.

This sense of steadiness flowed into my spiritual life as well. My walk with God wasn't a "bull run" of dramatic highs, but it was consistent and stable. I found a quiet, enduring strength in serving in my local church and realized a rhythm that didn't require performance but simply just presence, learning that a faith that simply stays the course is often the most resilient. I am so deeply grateful to God for that stability and for the gift of family, who remained my constant through every shift.

Because I stopped chasing external noise, I was able to make a trade that saved me. I chose peace over pace. While my career growth was quiet on paper, the internal reward was invaluable. I was less absent, more present, and for the first time in a long while, I lived my life. I felt the true weight of my friendships and leaned into the warmth of connection, realizing that you can only truly feel friendship when you stop rushing past it. I had my relapses moments where the old shadows tried to return but they were just reminders of how far the light has actually reached.

Now, as the year closes, the builder in me is finally waking up. I've begun the "fingers crossed" journey of starting my own businesses, planting seeds with a quiet confidence I didn't have before.

I'm ending 2025 with a clear head and a very full heart, thankful to God for the grace to stay standing and the wisdom to see that being present is the greatest success of all. I may not have reached the top of the mountain this year, but for the first time, I actually enjoyed the view from where I stood. I'm stepping into the new year not with a list of demands, but with a soul that is finally, beautifully at rest.

So, here's to 2025 a year that taught me the power of presence, the beauty of stillness, and the quiet strength that comes from simply being. I look forward to what 2026 will bring, but for now, I'm just grateful for the peace I've found in this moment.

The year started with a bang. Not the "exciting New Year's resolutions" kind, but the kind that hits you in the gut, making you question everything. A long-term relationship ended, and just when I thought I couldn't get any lower, I found myself unemployed for most of the year. Oh, and to add a cherry on top, I was fighting a major addiction that had been a quiet but persistent presence in my life for far too long.

It felt like I was sinking into a pit I couldn't climb out of. Heartbroken, jobless, and wrestling with my own demons—it seemed like everything I had built was falling apart. There were days when it felt like the only thing left to do was just let go and let the pieces scatter. But somehow, amid all the mess, I did something I wasn't expecting. I turned to my faith.

I started reading the Bible on my own, diving into the Gospel with no real plan except to find some kind of peace or purpose to hold onto. I wasn't looking for immediate answers or a miracle fix, but I was desperate for something—anything—that could help me make sense of the chaos. Slowly but surely, my faith started to shift from a distant belief system to something personal. It wasn't about "getting it right" or pretending to have it all together. It was about accepting God's grace even when I felt like a failure.

Along the way, I battled my addiction—sometimes stumbling, sometimes succeeding. But each day I fought, I discovered a little more about myself, my strength, and my need for support. And, boy, did I need support. My family, friends, and a few key persons became my lifeline. They reminded me of God's love when I couldn't see it, and they were there for me in ways I didn't know I needed. I'm not sure I could have made it without them. Their encouragement helped me keep going even when I felt like I had nothing left to give.

By the time summer came around, I hadn't fixed everything. I was still healing, still battling, but I was stronger than I had been in a long time. My faith was deeper. And then, just when I thought the year couldn't possibly throw anything else my way, something amazing happened: I landed a job.

It wasn't just any job—it was a reminder that, even in the chaos, God was still working things out for me. I walked into that new role feeling more confident and grounded than I ever thought I could be. And let me tell you, after months of unemployment, that first paycheck felt like a small miracle. But more than that, the job gave me a sense of purpose and routine that I hadn't realized I desperately needed.

And, as if the universe wasn't done with me yet, I found myself opening my heart to the possibility of love again. Yes, love. After months of battling my own heartache and insecurities, I allowed myself to take the risk of trusting someone again. It was terrifying at first, but as I leaned into it with more courage, I realized I was ready for something new. And, shockingly, that someone new might just be on the horizon.

But the real twist of the year, the unexpected gift, was the peace I found in myself. I've never felt saner in my life. I'm not just talking about the absence of addiction or the relief of having a job—though those things are huge. I'm talking about the quiet certainty that, no matter what, I'm going to be okay. That, no matter what happens with the job, the relationships, or the future, I'm not defined by what I don't have or by the mistakes I've made. I'm defined by who I am in Christ. And that knowledge has given me a peace I never expected to find.

So, as this year comes to a close, I'm not where I thought I'd be. But I'm so much better than I was. I've battled some of the hardest parts of my life—addiction, heartbreak, job loss—and come out on the other side with more strength, faith, and clarity than I could have imagined. I've learned that faith isn't about perfection. It's about showing up, even when you don't have it all together. It's about trusting that God will meet you in your brokenness and lead you to healing.

Next year? I have no idea. But I do know this: I'm going into it with a stronger belief system, a clearer sense of self, and a renewed hope for what's to come. And for the first time in a long time, I'm actually excited to find out what happens next.
